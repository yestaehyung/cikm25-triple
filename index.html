                In this paper, we propose TRIPLE, (TPB-dRIven Profiling with LLM
                rEfinement), a dynamic profiling framework that incorporates the
                Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) into user profile modeling. Our
                method (1) extracts TPB components from historical text data to
                construct an initial user profile, (2) iteratively refines this
                profile by analyzing discrepancies between predicted and actual
                behaviors, and (3) continuously updates the user’s state by
                incorporating newly arriving text. We evaluate TRIPLE on the
                LaMP datasets, focusing on rating prediction and personalized
                tweet paraphrasing tasks, using multiple open-source large
                language models. Experimental results demonstrate that TRIPLE
                consistently outperforms existing profiling methods across all
                evaluation settings. Qualitative analysis confirms that TRIPLE
                captures the psychological and social mechanisms underlying
                users' product evaluation and description. These findings
                provide empirical evidence that theory-driven user profiling can
                significantly improve personalization performance in recommender
                systems and related applications.

              <p>
                Accurate user profiling remains a central challenge in
                personalized services. While behavioral intentions are shaped by
                personal attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral
                control, existing LLM-based profiling approaches often extract
                only surface-level preferences without systematically modeling
                the core latent variables that drive user behavior.
              </p>
              <p>
                To address these limitations, we propose
                <strong>TRIPLE</strong> (TPB-dRIven Profiling with LLM
                rEfinement), a dynamic profiling framework that incorporates the
                Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) into user modeling. TRIPLE
                leverages LLM reasoning to extract key TPB components—attitude,
                subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control—from input
                data and represent them in natural language. These latent
                variables are then continuously updated through a
                prediction-evaluation-refinement cycle to better reflect
                evolving user states.

                This work presents the first systematic integration of
                social-psychological theory into LLM-based profiling, offering
                broad applicability across various LLMs without the need for
                additional training. TRIPLE demonstrates strong potential for
                application across diverse domains, offering insights to guide
                future research.

                  <strong>LaMP-3 (Product Rating Prediction):</strong> This task
                  involves predicting product ratings on a 1-5 scale for Amazon
                  items based on users' review histories. The dataset contains
                  2,500 test samples, and performance is evaluated using Mean
                  Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>LaMP-4 (News Headline Generation):</strong> This task
                  involves generating personalized news headlines that match a
                  user's writing style. It includes 1,800 test samples, with
                  performance evaluated using ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L scores.

                TRIPLE consistently achieves the highest or second-highest
                performance across all evaluation models and tasks, even without
                the refinement cycle. The results underscore our hypothesis that
                modeling core latent variables yields more accurate behavioral
                predictions than capturing surface-level preferences.

              <h3 class="title is-4">Role of Profile Refinement</h3>
              <p>
                The iterative refinement process progressively enhances the
                model's ability to capture users' core latent variables. As
                shown below, performance consistently improves with more
                refinement iterations (R0 to R5), validating that the errors
                identified during evaluation successfully guide adjustments to
                the TPB representations.

              <p>
                Our dynamic update method (blue line) achieves the highest
                performance and shows progressive improvements over time. In
                contrast, fully regenerating the profile from scratch (orange
                line) or using a simple sliding window (purple line) fails to
                effectively capture the evolving nature of users' long-term
                latent variables.

              <p>
                Our framework's core refinement cycle is a form of error
                analysis in action. The process assesses how well the current
                user profile contributes to behavior prediction and continuously
                updates it to minimize prediction error.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a prediction (e.g., a product rating) generated from the
                user's profile is incorrect, the discrepancy between the
                predicted behavior and the ground truth is used as a signal. The
                LLM is then prompted to refine the user's TPB profile (Attitude,
                Subjective Norm, Perceived Behavioral Control) based on this
                error and a generated explanation. This iterative process allows
                TRIPLE to dynamically correct and adapt the user's psychological
                profile, leading to more accurate predictions in subsequent
                steps.

              <p>
                The TRIPLE framework consists of four main stages: (1)
                generating an initial profile by extracting TPB components using
                an LLM, (2) performing a personalization task using the
                generated profile, (3) refining the profile based on behavior
                prediction results, and (4) dynamically updating the user
                profile over time. The overall architecture is illustrated in
                the figure at the top of the page.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>1. TPB-based Initial Profile Construction:</strong> We
                analyze a user's textual data using an LLM to extract the three
                key components of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB):
                <em>attitude</em>, <em>subjective norm</em>, and
                <em>perceived behavioral control</em>. These are stored in a
                structured JSON format.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>2. Profile Refinement:</strong> We adopt an iterative
                cycle of prediction, evaluation, and refinement. Given a
                profile, the model predicts user behavior. The prediction is
                compared with the ground truth, and the resulting error is used
                to prompt the LLM to refine the profile. This is repeated N
                times (N=5 in our experiments) to select the best-performing
                profile.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>3. Profile Update:</strong> To capture temporal changes,
                the optimal profile from the previous time step is used as the
                starting point for refinement with new user data. This allows
                the model to progressively adapt to the user's evolving
                preferences and behavioral patterns over time.

                While traditional methods like collaborative filtering often
                lack interpretability, the advent of LLMs has opened new avenues
                for personalized recommendation. Recent studies have explored
                summarizing user interactions or constructing intermediate user
                profiles from text. For example, GPG extracts writing styles and
                preferences, while PURE incrementally updates profiles based on
                user likes and dislikes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite these advances, most existing LLM-based methods focus on
                identifying surface-level features like favored keywords or
                writing styles, without modeling the deeper psychosocial
                mechanisms that drive decisions. User profiles are often treated
                as static or updated naively. To overcome these limitations, we
                propose incorporating the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), a
                foundational framework in social psychology, into LLM-based user
                profiling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
                to successfully incorporate a theory-driven approach into
                LLM-based personalization.
